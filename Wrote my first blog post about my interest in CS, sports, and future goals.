## 💻 How It All Started  
I still remember the first time I wrote a Python program. It was just a simple "Hello, World!" but it felt like I had done something cool. That one line got me interested in how computers work and how we can tell them what to do using code.

## 🧪 Learning Through Research  
Right now, I’m working on a research project. It’s been a new experience for me—reading, writing, collecting data, and trying to find real-world solutions. Even though it’s still in progress, it’s shown me how powerful technology and ideas can be when we apply them to real problems.

## 🏀 Sports & Tech  
I’m also the national captain of my basketball team. Sports taught me how to stay focused, lead a team, and never give up. I feel the same way when I code—sometimes it doesn’t work at first, but if I keep trying, I figure it out.
